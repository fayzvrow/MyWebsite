        <h1>Who I Am</h1>

        <p class="para-box">
            Hi, I'm Faysal Abdulkadir, a senior Computer Science major at Georgia State University, 
            with a love for full-stack development. I'm passionate about building websites and apps that are not just functional 
            but also easy and fun to use. I've worked with <span class="i">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL</span>, and I'm comfortable 
            working on both front-end and back-end. I enjoy solving problems and collaborating with others 
            to bring ideas to life.
        </p>

        <p class="para-box">
            I was born in Atlanta, GA, as the first gerneation of my family to be born in America, while my parents are from Nigeria. 
            I travel bach home often, and experiencing life there is always eye-opening, it's very different from my daily life here. 
            When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me at the gym, unwinding with video games, or showing off my ping pong skills.
        </p>

        <p class="para-box">
            Listening to music and binging series are big part of my downtime. My favorite artists are <span class="i">Gunna, Juice WRLD, and 
            A Boogie with da Hoodie</span>. I love TV shows like <span class="i">Once Upon a Time (all-time favorite), YOU, Regular Show, Black Clover, 
            Vinland Saga, and Attack on Titan</span>. I also enjoy reading <span class="i">The Outsiders</span>, and I'm a huge Marvel fan —— basically anything 
            with superheroes.
        </p>

        <p class="para-box">
            I've been to places like Dubai and Mecca, and being there really motivated me to stay focused on my full-stack goals. 
            Seeing such an immersive place made me want to work hard and create opportunities for myself in the future.
        </p>

        <p class="para-box">
            I picked Computer Science because when I was younger, I loved building things with LEGOs —— figuring out how different pieces fit together and creating 
            something from scratch gave me a real sense of joy and curiosity. As I grew older, I realized that building in the digital world as a full-stack developer 
            is a natural extension of that same curiosity and creativity. At times——especially during long nights——writing code can be challenging, but those moments are 
            also the ones that teach me the most, including patience. Coding allows me to design, problem-solve, and bring ideas to life in a way that's dynamic and always 
            developing. I know it's not going to be easy, but I live by the quote: "<span class="i">In life, you can't grow when comfortable.</span>" It's a reminder to keep 
            learning, challenging myself, and building skills every day.
        </p>
